- simplified boundary checking: sometimes gives performance gain (!) due to one
  loop variable less
- optimized loop variable design following "The HERMIT in the Stream" (Farmer
  et al, 2014)
- somewhat nicer programmer interfaces
- less type classes to worry about
- there should be no loss of performance

0.2.x.x
-------

- Streamlined interface: access everything via ADP.Fusion
